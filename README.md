# Tech Blog

## Description
A platform designed for developers to share their insights and engage with the tech community. It allows users to publish their own blog posts, covering technical concepts, recent advancements, and personal experiences in development. Additionally, the app fosters interaction by enabling users to comment on and discuss other developersâ€™ posts, creating a collaborative environment for learning and growth. Built with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, it leverages Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session for secure user authentication. The goal is to create a seamless, intuitive experience reminiscent of a modern CMS like WordPress, tailored specifically for the needs of developers.
